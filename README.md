# Decentralized Prediction Market

A comprehensive prediction market smart contract built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity. This contract enables users to create prediction markets, trade on outcomes, provide liquidity, and resolve markets through a decentralized oracle system.

## üåü Features

### üìä **Market Creation**
- **Multi-outcome Markets**: Support for up to 10 different outcomes per market
- **Flexible Parameters**: Customizable fees, minimum trade amounts, and resolution times
- **Category System**: Organize markets by categories (crypto, sports, politics, etc.)
- **Oracle Integration**: Each market requires a designated oracle for resolution

### üí∞ **Trading System**
- **AMM-Style Pricing**: Automated Market Maker with dynamic pricing based on liquidity
- **Buy/Sell Shares**: Trade on any outcome with real-time price discovery
- **Minimum Trade Amounts**: Configurable minimum trade sizes per market
- **Position Tracking**: Track user positions across multiple outcomes

### üåä **Liquidity Provision**
- **Add Liquidity**: Provide liquidity to earn fees from trading
- **Proportional Shares**: Liquidity providers receive shares proportional to their contribution
- **Remove Liquidity**: Exit liquidity positions after market resolution

### ‚öñÔ∏è **Oracle & Resolution System**
- **Multi-Oracle Support**: Support for multiple trusted oracles
- **Reputation System**: Oracle reputation tracking (0-100%)
- **Dispute Mechanism**: Users can dispute oracle resolutions with stake
- **Time-Locked Resolution**: Dispute period before final settlement

### üèõÔ∏è **Governance**
- **Owner Controls**: Contract owner can manage oracles and system parameters
- **Fee Management**: Adjustable protocol fees and oracle fees
- **Parameter Updates**: Modify dispute periods, minimum stakes, etc.

## üìñ Usage Guide

### 1. Initialize Contract

The contract must be initialized by the owner with a list of trusted oracles:

```clarity
(contract-call? .prediction-market initialize 
  (list 'SP1ABC... 'SP2DEF... 'SP3GHI...))
```

### 2. Create a Market

Anyone can create a prediction market:

```clarity
(contract-call? .prediction-market create-market
  u"Will BTC exceed $100k by end of 2025?"  ;; description
  "crypto"                                  ;; category
  (list u"Yes" u"No")                      ;; outcomes
  u1000                                    ;; resolution-time (block height)
  u900                                     ;; closing-time (block height)
  u250                                     ;; fee-percentage (2.5%)
  'SP1ORACLE...                           ;; oracle
  u10000000                               ;; oracle-fee (10 STX)
  u1000000                                ;; min-trade-amount (1 STX)
  (some u"Additional market details"))     ;; additional-data
```

### 3. Add Liquidity

Provide liquidity to earn trading fees:

```clarity
(contract-call? .prediction-market add-liquidity 
  u1           ;; market-id
  u50000000)   ;; amount (50 STX)
```

### 4. Trade Shares

Buy shares in a specific outcome:

```clarity
(contract-call? .prediction-market buy-shares
  u1           ;; market-id
  u0           ;; outcome-id (0 = "Yes")
  u10000000)   ;; amount (10 STX)
```

Sell shares:

```clarity
(contract-call? .prediction-market sell-shares
  u1           ;; market-id
  u0           ;; outcome-id
  u5000000)    ;; shares to sell
```

### 5. Resolve Market

Oracle resolves the market after closing:

```clarity
(contract-call? .prediction-market resolve-market
  u1  ;; market-id
  u1) ;; winning-outcome-id
```

### 6. Dispute Resolution

Users can dispute within the dispute period:

```clarity
(contract-call? .prediction-market dispute-resolution
  u1           ;; market-id
  u0           ;; proposed-outcome-id
  u2000000)    ;; stake-amount (2 STX)
```

### 7. Finalize & Claim

After dispute period, anyone can finalize:

```clarity
(contract-call? .prediction-market finalize-market u1)
```

Winners claim their payouts:

```clarity
(contract-call? .prediction-market claim-winnings u1)
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Access Control
- **Owner Functions**: Critical functions protected by owner-only modifier
- **Oracle Authorization**: Only authorized oracles can resolve markets
- **Balance Checks**: All transfers validated against user balances

### Economic Security
- **Dispute Stakes**: Minimum stake required to prevent spam disputes
- **Time Locks**: Dispute periods prevent immediate finalization
- **Fee Caps**: Maximum fees prevent exploitation

### Data Validation
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs validated
- **Range Checks**: Numeric parameters within acceptable ranges
- **State Validation**: Market state transitions properly controlled
